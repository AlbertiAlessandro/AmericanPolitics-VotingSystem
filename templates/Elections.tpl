    <h1>US Elections Process</h1>
    <div class="president-info">
        <p>In the United States, elections are held to choose various public officials at federal, state, and local levels. The most prominent among these is the presidential election, which occurs every four years.</p>
        <p>The process begins with primaries and caucuses, where political parties select their candidates for the general election. Primaries are elections where registered voters can participate in selecting the party's candidate. Caucuses are local meetings where party members discuss and vote for their preferred candidate.</p>
        <p>Following the primaries and caucuses, each political party holds a national convention to officially nominate their candidate for president and vice president. These conventions also serve to unify the party and establish their platform.</p>
        <p>The general election is held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. During this election, voters cast their ballots for the candidates of their choice. The candidate who wins the majority of electoral votes becomes the President of the United States. Electoral votes are allocated to each state based on its population.</p>
        <p>Throughout this process, various rules and regulations govern the conduct of elections to ensure fairness and transparency. The Electoral College system, though debated, remains a cornerstone of the American electoral process.</p>
